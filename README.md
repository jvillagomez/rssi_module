With IoT projects at an all time high, there is a continuous need for positioning and localization systems in places where 
GPS localiztion is not available. RSSI-based localization offers the ability to find an unknown position using the 
RSSI (relative received signal strength) of nearby access-points (wifi routers). RSSI-based localiztion algortihms require 'n' number
of access points, where 'n' >= 3 access points. With the development of wireless are networks and smart devices, the number
of WIFI access point in buildings is increasing, as long as a mobile smart device can detect three or more
known WIFI hotspotsâ€™ positions, it would be relatively easy to realize self-localization (Usually WIFI access points
locations are fixed, but modifications acn be made for moving access points).

This module contains two classes, 'RSSI_Scan' and 'RSSI_Localizer'.
RSSI_Scan is used to find and return information on all available access points, within range.
A 'networks' list can be provided as an argument to filter networks of interest.

RSSI_Localizer is used for self-localization, using the information returned by RSSI_Scan. this 
class can not be used, without the use of three or more known accesspoints.

The algorithm used in this module is entirely base off of Xiuyan Zhu's, Yuan Feng's 
'RSSI-based Algorithm for Indoor Localization' paper, published here: https://file.scirp.org/pdf/CN_2013071010352139.pdf

There are exisitng Python and Java modules for network scanning and RSSI-localization, but there was a need for 
a more extensive package that scales for a virtually unlimited number of Wifi access points. An emphasis was placed on documentation
and easability of use. Both classes cna be used independently, if desired.

This package asdesigned to be as light and effciient as possible, for use in real-time or soft real-time environments.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

A Python interpreter will be neccesary to run this module. Package is compatible with Python 2.x or 3.x.

The NumPy library will need to be installed, before using this package. We will be updating this package to include the NumPy dependency. See 'Built With' section for installation of NumPy.

#### Fixe python3 error - 2020/02/13 (benbenIo)
```shell
raw_cells = raw_cell_string.split('Cell') # Divide raw string into raw cells.
TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'
```

### Installing

The RSSI package can be installed via PIP or by cloning this GitHub repo. Future releases will include a package installer for Linux.

Say what the step will be

```
pip install rssi
```

OR

```
git clone https://github.com/jvillagomez/rssi_module.git
cd rssi_module
pip install .
```
### Classes

The RSSI package comes woth two classes to help you with scanning for access points (RSS_Scan) and RSSi-based, self-localization (RSSI_Localizer).
Methods for both classes can be found below.

## Sample Usage

The following example shows how to use the RSSI_Scan and RSSI_Localizer classes, within the rssi module.

### Initialize RSSI_Scan

This class helps us scan for all available access points, within reach.
User must supply a network interface name, at initialization.
i.e wlan0, docker0, wlp1s0
```
import rssi

interface = 'wlp1s0'
rssi_scanner = rssi.RSSI_Scan(interface)
```
### Scan for access points

#### Scan for specific access points
```
import rssi

interface = 'wlp1s0'
rssi_scanner = rssi.RSSI_Scan(interface)

ssids = ['dd-wrt','linksys']

# sudo argument automatixally gets set for 'false', if the 'true' is not set manually.
# python file will have to be run with sudo privileges.
ap_info = rssi_scanner.getAPinfo(networks=ssids, sudo=True)

print(ap_info)

# prints
# [
#     {
#         'ssid':'ucrwpa',
#         'quality':'43/70',
#         'signal':'-67'
#     },
#     {
#         'ssid':'dd-wrt',
#         'quality':'30/70',
#         'signal':'-42'
#     }
# ]
```
#### Scan for all access points
```
import rssi

interface = 'wlp1s0'
rssi_scanner = rssi.RSSI_Scan(interface)

ssids = ['dd-wrt','linksys']

# sudo argument automatixally gets set for 'false', if the 'true' is not set manually.
# python file will have to be run with sudo privileges.
ap_info = rssi_scanner.getAPinfo(sudo=True)

print(ap_info)

# prints
# [
#     {
#         'ssid':'ucrwpa',
#         'quality':'43/70',
#         'signal':'-67'
#     },
#     {
#         'ssid':'dd-wrt',
#         'quality':'30/70',
#         'signal':'-42'
#     },
#     {
#         'ssid':'rosNet',
#         'quality':'30/70',
#         'signal':'-42'
#     },
#     {
#         'ssid':'openNetw',
#         'quality':'30/70',
#         'signal':'-42'
#     }
# ] 
```

### Initialize the RSSI-based localizer
#### RSSI_Localizer
```
# Use:
    # from rssi import RSSI_Localizer
    # rssi_localizer_instance = RSSI_Localizer(accessPoints=accessPoints)
# -------------------------------------------------------
# Description:
    # This class helps a user implement rssi-based localization.
    # The algorithm assumes the logarithmic distance-path-loss model
    # And assumes a minimum of 3 (or more) access points.
# -------------------------------------------------------
# Input:
    # accessPoints: Array holding accessPoint dictionaries.
    #               The order of the arrays supplied will retain
    #               its order, throughout the entire execution.
    # [{
    #     'signalAttenuation': 3, 
    #     'location': {
    #         'y': 1, 
    #         'x': 1
    #     }, 
    #     'reference': {
    #         'distance': 4, 
    #         'signal': -50
    #     }, 
    #     'name': 'dd-wrt'
    # },
    # {
    #     'signalAttenuation': 4, 
    #     'location': {
    #         'y': 1, 
    #         'x': 7
    #     }, 
    #     'reference': {
    #         'distance': 3, 
    #         'signal': -41
    #     }, 
    #     'name': 'ucrwpa'
    # }]
```
#### Estimate distance from access point
```
from rssi import RSSI_Localizer
rssi_localizer_instance = RSSI_Localizer()

accessPoint = {
     'signalAttenuation': 3, 
     'location': {
         'y': 1, 
         'x': 1
     }, 
     'reference': {
         'distance': 4, 
         'signal': -50
     }, 
     'name': 'dd-wrt'
}
signalStrength = -69

distance = rssi_localizer_instance.getDistanceFromAP(accessPoint, signalStrength)
print(distance)

# prints
# {
#     'signalAttenuation': 3, 
#     'location': {
#         'y': 1, 
#         'x': 1
#     }, 
#     'reference': {
#         'distance': 4, 
#         'signal': -50
#     }, 
#     'name': 'dd-wrt',
#     'distance': 2
# }
```

#### Estimate distances form all access points
```
Same as the exmaple above, except accessPoints 
need to be fed into the funciton inside of list.

The function will also return the same output as above in a list.

List order is persistent.
```

#### Perform RSSI-based, self-localization
```
Assuming RSSI_Scan and RSSI_Localizer have already been initialized.
ap_info = rssi.getAPinfo(networks=ssids, sudo=True)
rssi_values = [ap['signal'] for ap in ap_info]
position = localizer.getNodePosition(rssi_values)
print(position)

# prints a 1-D array holding [x,y]
```

## Built With

This package remained incredibly light. The only dependency outside of native Python packages is 'NumPy'.

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome! This package was created because of the neccesity for an easy to use module, featuring great documentation, that scales for all uses. All comments, requests, and and recomendations are welcome.
